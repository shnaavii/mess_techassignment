 Created a basic SaaS platform that allows users to log in, retrieve order data from Shopify using their API credentials, and present the information on a dashboard.
I utilized PHP as the backend language, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were employed for the frontend. The data is fetched using customer email linked to Shopify.
To get started, first import the SQL file into XAMPP, then download the zip folder, and run the registration.html page as the index.
Next, enter the correct email associated with the Shopify API file to log in, which will redirect you to the dashboard.
Here, you can view all your order details.
I have included several emails that can be found in the XAMPP database import; there is a table called 'users' for user login and registration.
Sorting and filtering proved to be quite challenging.
